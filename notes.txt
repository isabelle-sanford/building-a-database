Questions / thoughts: 
Do I need to care about pointers? YUP
How do the driver / sql packages interact with what I need to do? Do I need to implement the functions in driver? 




Package stuff
- sync will be useful for concurrency

Useful tutorial stuff:
https://go.dev/doc/effective_go
https://pkg.go.dev/std standard library
https://go.dev/ref/spec language spec
https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/call-module-code modules / tutorial

Package driver defines interfaces for drivers to implement - probably what I want / equivalent of JDBC? 
https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql/driver@go1.19.4
https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SQLDrivers
https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql@go1.19.4
https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql@go1.19.4
https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SQLInterface

for now going for just the block / page things, figure out how to wrap into JDBC-equivalent later 

probs do NOT want syscall bc it's system-specific stuff - os is better

might use unsafe? 

SO on reading and writing bytes - 
I could use a Reader for reading and a Writer for writing but that's creating a reading/writing object each time when I'd rather just have a wrapper for the bytes overall (like java bytebuffer) or access directly via slices (which ... should work?)
Question with slices is how to convert from some bytes to an int ? is there a parseInt for bytes? 
ok yes but I'm still making a reader each time... is that ok? 

something something changing stuff inside functions 
how do I make it so that the write actually sticks? 

APPARENTLY I just needed to give it *Page instead of Page >:( but hey it works now!!

12/21 8pm - Page works, questions remaining:
How to pass blocksize as a constant that you can specify the size of an array with 
How to allow multiple constructors (/ functions) with the same name but different arguments
Is making a [BLOCKSIZE]byte actually a page from the OS? How do I know / trust that? 
Also is blocksize in bits or bytes - 4096 bits or 4096 bytes? 


Important: need to get block / int sizes from single source eventually - how to pull between pages? 
ERROR HANDLING EVERYWHERE
REMEMBER TO CLOSE FILES <- defer thingy?

Error: if you write a page to a block in a file, trying to read from any subsequent block which has not been written to results in "Faield to read block in file: EOF" error and then a correct printing of the block contents (i.e. all 0s)

Problem: read / write functions are only allowed to be written to/from slices, not arrays, which means my page.contents is currently a slice, which - as far as I can tell is worse? Even though I can set capacity at 4096?
