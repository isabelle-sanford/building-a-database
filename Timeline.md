# Project Timeline


**Friday, 1/20**: complete work for chapter 7 (table manager and statistics manager)

**Friday, 1/27**: finish chapters 8 and 9 (basic query processing/parsing) in order to start on evaluation

At this point, the database should be functional (albeit at a very basic level). I should then read all of chapters 10-15, so that I have a better idea of what I'm going to want to do next.

After that, I should probably do chapter 10, but after that can skip around. I could, for instance, pick two chapters and spend a couple weeks each on them. (As things go, that may be spending a month on one chapter or only 1 week.) Regardless, I should try to finish whatever I want to do by the end of February, so I can spend March on testing. (I could alternatively build tests directly after I finish the basic database, but I'm not 100% sure how that would work.) So something like: 

**1/27 - 2/3**: chapter 10 (planning), read rest of text

**2/3 - 2/17**: chapter X

**2/17 - 3/3**: chapter Y

**3/3 - 3/31**: investigation

The relevant chapters to choose from here are 12 (indexing), 13 (materialization and sorting), 14 (effective buffer utilization), and 15 (query optimization). I could also go back to chapter 5 and implement recovery and/or concurrency more thoroughly. 


Throughout:
- keep an eye on what things would be interesting variables for investigation of query processing
- look at the exercises at the end of each chapter and mark any that are interesting, especially in the context of query investigation
- consider how to explain / present these things in non-technical and semi-technical ways
